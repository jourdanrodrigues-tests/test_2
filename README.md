# Interview Test

Hi there. This is an app requested to test my skills for an interview.

Here are the _instructions.md_ (did not discover how to put links in BitBucket by now) file in this
repository.

### Style Guides Used

* [BEM (Block Element Modifier)](https://getbem.com/);
* [Git Commit Message Style Guide](https://github.com/slashsBin/styleguide-git-commit-message);
* [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).

### Useful commands

* `npm start`: Runs the application in production mode;
* `npm test`: Run tests*.

### Development

* Create a `.env` file;
* Specify `PRODUCTION=0` (which is the default) on it;
* Run `npm start`;
* Start coding like if there's no coffee tomorrow.

### "Production"

* Be amazed.
